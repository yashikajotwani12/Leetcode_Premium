 Pathing Problems
Report Issue
The last pattern we'll be looking at is pathing problems on a matrix. These problems have matrices as part of the input and give rules for "moving" through the matrix in the problem description. Typically, DP will be applicable when the allowed movement is constrained in a way that prevents moving "backwards", for example if we are only allowed to move down and right.


If we are allowed to move in all 4 directions, then it might be a graph/BFS problem instead. This pattern is sometimes combined with other patterns we have looked at, such as counting DP.

In terms of difficulty, these problems are usually less difficult than the average DP problem as the recurrence relation is usually directly related to the rules of traversal. Most of these problems are also very similar or are variations of each other, and because of this, knowing a general approach to these problems can go a long way.

Let's walk through one last example with the framework, and then finish this card with a few good practice problems.
