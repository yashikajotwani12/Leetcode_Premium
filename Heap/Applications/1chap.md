# Common applications of Heap

In most programming languages, Heaps are already built-in. Therefore, we usually do not need to implement a Heap from scratch. However, to use Heap adequately, we need to understand how Heap is commonly used.

In this chapter, we will learn how to:

* Construct a Max Heap and a Min Heap.
* Insert elements into a Heap.
* Get the top element of a Heap.
* Delete the top element from a Heap.
* Get the length of a Heap.
* Perform time and space complexity analysis for common applications that use a Heap.
