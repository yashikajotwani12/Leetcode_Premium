# Heap Insertion

* Insertion means adding an element to the Heap. After inserting the element, the properties of the Heap should remain unchanged.

# Heap Deletion

* Deletion means removing the “top” element from the Heap. After deleting the element, the property of Heap should remain unchanged.

# Implementation of a Heap

* We often perform insertion, deletion, and getting the top element with a Heap data structure.

* We can implement a Heap using an array. Elements in the Heap can be stored in the array in the form of a binary tree. The code below will implement “Max Heap” and “Min Heap” for integers (In LeetCode problems or daily work, we often will use existing libraries instead of manually implementing Heap).
